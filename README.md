### Others
- [ ] (in progress...) PDF embeddings visualization

*‚Üê Feel free to add any TODOs...*




## PDF embeddings visualization (in progress...)

Create an interactive 3D visualization of how a set of PDFs are semantically correlated using sentence embeddings (PyTorch).

### Install
```bash
conda create -n boost-proj python==3.12
conda activate boost-proj
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run (CLI)
Create embeddings
```bash
python pdf_correlator.py
```

Visualize embeddings
```bash
tensorboard --logdir tensorboard_logs
```
